            ><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> When a child’s airway is
            narrow, underdeveloped or constricted in any way, the child will
            struggle to receive enough oxygen at night and may resort to mouth
            breathing, which compounds this issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oral Appliance Therapy can help open up the airway of a growing
            child by bringing the upper and lower jaws forward and allowing the
            airway to widen. An open airway increases the oxygen the child
            receives to the brain, which restores the brain's function for the
            next day. This in turn leads to an improved immune system, hormonal
            system and an overall healthier child.

          <h3>The Dangers of Mouth Breathing</h3>
          <h5>Mouth Breathing and Compromising the Airway</h5>
          <p>
            Mouth breathing is not the same as nasal breathing and often leads
            to further compromise of the airway. The dangers of mouth breathing
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Can be a contributing factor to a compromised airway and the need
              for orthodontic treatment
            </li>
            <li>Improper exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen</li>
            <li>
              Prevents the proper function of the tongue and other orofacial
              muscles that children need to speak, swallow, chew and function
              properly
            </li>
            <li>
              Can cause the delicate tissues of the tonsils and adenoids to
              swell and become enlarged, further impacting a restricted airway

              >The Problem with Conventional Treatment Options - they don’t
              treat the airway.</strong
            >
            Before now, treatment options such as prescription drugs, surgery,
            clinical therapy, academic tutors, sleeping, and years in braces
            have been the most commonly prescribed "solutions".
          </p>
          <p>
            None of these conventional treatments can promote or develop a
            child’s airway and help them get the oxygen and sleep they need to
            be healthy. Conventional treatments have been limited and
            ineffective, mainly because they address the symptoms rather than
            the potential root cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >An oral appliance addresses the root cause early-in-life, because
              early treatment is crucial.</strong
            >
            When children are young, their bodies are able to adjust and mold
            easily, particularly in their mouth and their bone structure.
            Crowded teeth may force the tongue forward against their teeth,
            narrowing their dental arch and constricting the airway. Breathing
            properly is necessary for the health of a child.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to addressing the airway issues and alleviating sleep
            disordered breathing oral appliances can properly align the teeth.

          <h3>Straightening Teeth WITHOUT Braces</h3>
          <p>
            At nearly HALF the cost of braces, therapy with an oral device is a
            revolutionary departure from traditional orthodontics into an early,
            non-invasive, natural approach to straightening teeth. It works with
            natural growth patterns, teaching the tongue to stay in proper
            position, keeping lips closed to increase nasal breathing, proper
            tongue position when swallowing and normal arch length.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Sleep disordered breathing in children can be noted by the following
            symptoms:
          </h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Restless sleep</li>
            <li>ADD/ADHD</li>
            <li>Bedwetting</li>
            <li>Allergies</li>
            <li>Nightmares</li>
            <li>Anger</li>
            <li>Difficult in school</li>
            <li>Frequent infections</li>

          <p>
            Sleep Disordered Breathing increases risk of ADD/ADHD by 50%
            (Bonuck, 2012) Children that exhibit ADD/ADHD may have a sleep
            disorder that keeps them in a stage of sleep that does not allow for
            growth and development. The brain does not have the ability to heal
            due to lack of a restorative sleep stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bedwetting and snoring are common in children with sleep disordered
            breathing again due to the fact that they do not spend enough time
            in a restorative healing stage but more in a restless one. When they
            can’t breathe, they don’t sleep properly. Snoring is not normal. It
            is the brain’s way of alerting us to an airway problem.

          <h3>Why start treatment early?</h3>
          <p>
            Children experience a number of growth spurts leading up to puberty.
            Each of those growth spurts can be used to harness the natural
            forces of the body to guide ideal jaw and tooth positioning.
            "Waiting until all the permanent teeth are in" is an archaic,
            deficient methodology for treating malocclusion, and more often than
            not, "traditional orthodontics" will straighten teeth but will not
            eliminate unhealthy oral habits, which will lead to either needing
            lifetime retention (a permanent retainer) or relapse of teeth in
            adulthood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Poor oral habits such as mouth breathing, thumb sucking, and an
            anterior tongue thrust cause a myriad of chronic inflammatory
            responses as well as dental malocclusion issues. It's important to
            note...
            <strong
              >These habits & malocclusions DO NOT SELF CORRECT! And they only
              get more difficult to treat with age.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Oral appliance therapy establishes nasal breathing which increases
            oxygen intake and ensures proper progression through stages of
            sleep. (what the brain needs to heal and promote growth). They
            eliminate bad habits such as mouth breathing, thumb sucking, tongue
            thrust, reverse swallow and eliminates open bite malocclusions. They
            train the tongue to a position that allows the airway to remain
            open, promote proper swallowing and proper speech development.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to start early!!! Habit correctors can start as early as two
            years of age. Ideally we want to begin guiding the tongue as soon as
            possible but a pronounced crowding in the dentition of a five year
            old, open mouth postures and a weak chin are signs that the skeletal
            growth is off. Craniofacial growth between 5 and 7 years of age is
            critical to capturing correct arch width. We need to have enough
            space for the adult teeth to erupt into proper position. The same
            appliance that helps to open the airway also helps maintain
            craniofacial growth and gives the dental arches and teeth a guide to 
            grow correctly. Greater than 80% of children that begin this therapy
            will not need subsequent orthodontic treatment. An added bonus to
            managing the craniofacial growth for proper airway is that the
            complete complex grows in a normal pattern, hence the teeth will
            too.

        <section id="CanYouMakeAnApplianceJustForSnoring" class="">
          <h3>Can you make an appliance just for snoring?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, dental sleep devices work quite well at reducing the sound and
            severity of snoring. However, if you are a snorer and have never had
            a sleep test, it is advisable to be screened or tested for the more
            serious disorder of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Many snorers also
            have obstructive sleep apnea, often without even realizing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a diagnosis of made of Primary Snoring then a dental sleep device
            can be made to control the sound and severity of your snoring.
            Usually, the procedures needed to treat snoring are simpler than for
            treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. This often results in fewer
            office visits and follow-up observations for people whose primary
            symptom is snoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Treating snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) with dental sleep
            devices requires specialty training. It isn’t just a matter making a
            mouth piece and pushing you out the door. Successful treatment
            begins with choosing a dentist that has the proper specialty
            training in Dental Sleep Medicine. Success also relies on having the
            proper systems and clinical experience needed to effectively
            implement dental sleep therapy treatment.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="IsACustomDeviceReallyNecessary" class="">
          <h3>Is a custom device really necessary?</h3>
          <p>
            Custom-made adjustable dental sleep devices are far more effective
            and comfortable than self-fitting, “boil and bite” devices that
            sometimes appear on television commercials. The self-fitting devices
            are typically much larger, which decreases their effectiveness
            because the device may actually obstruct your airway during sleep.
            Most “as seen on TV” self-fitting devices are not adjustable, which
            can lead to discomfort and pain. Successful dental sleep therapy is
            extremely dependent on precise adjustments of the dental sleep
            device. Without this ability to finely adjust the device, treatment
            success rates drop dramatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious and life threatening
            medical disorder. It is unwise to treat obstructive sleep apnea or
            any other serious medical problem without proper medical supervision
            and guidance. Failure to seek medical supervision and ‘do it
            yourself’ can have serious medical risks, and can lead you to
            believe the problem is fixed when in fact it is not.

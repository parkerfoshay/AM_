                <h3>The Airway</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Why does it matter?</strong> When a child’s airway is
                  narrow, underdeveloped or constricted in any way, the child
                  will struggle to receive enough oxygen at night and may resort
                  to mouth breathing, which compounds this issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Oral Appliance Therapy can help open up the airway of a
                  growing child by bringing the upper and lower jaws forward and
                  allowing the airway to widen. An open airway increases the
                  oxygen the child receives to the brain, which restores the
                  brain's function for the next day. This in turn leads to an
                  improved immune system, hormonal system and an overall
                  healthier child.

          <h3>The Dangers of Mouth Breathing</h3>
          <h5>Mouth Breathing and Compromising the Airway</h5>
          <p>
            Mouth breathing is not the same as nasal breathing and often leads
            to further compromise of the airway. The dangers of mouth breathing
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Can be a contributing factor to a compromised airway and the need
              for orthodontic treatment
            </li>
            <li>Improper exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen</li>
            <li>
              Prevents the proper function of the tongue and other orofacial
              muscles that children need to speak, swallow, chew and function
              properly
            </li>
            <li>
              Can cause the delicate tissues of the tonsils and adenoids to
              swell and become enlarged, further impacting a restricted airway
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Conventional "Treatment" Options</h3>
          <p>
            <strong
              >The Problem with Conventional Treatment Options - they don’t
              treat the airway.</strong
            >
            Before now, treatment options such as prescription drugs, surgery,
            clinical therapy, academic tutors, sleeping, and years in braces
            have been the most commonly prescribed "solutions".
          </p>
          <p>
            None of these conventional treatments can promote or develop a
            child’s airway and help them get the oxygen and sleep they need to
            be healthy. Conventional treatments have been limited and
            ineffective, mainly because they address the symptoms rather than
            the potential root cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >An oral appliance addresses the root cause early-in-life, because
              early treatment is crucial.</strong
            >
            When children are young, their bodies are able to adjust and mold
            easily, particularly in their mouth and their bone structure.
            Crowded teeth may force the tongue forward against their teeth,
            narrowing their dental arch and constricting the airway. Breathing
            properly is necessary for the health of a child.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to addressing the airway issues and alleviating sleep
            disordered breathing oral appliances can properly align the teeth.

          <h3>Straightening Teeth WITHOUT Braces</h3>
          <p>
            At nearly HALF the cost of braces, therapy with an oral device is a
            revolutionary departure from traditional orthodontics into an early,
            non-invasive, natural approach to straightening teeth. It works with
            natural growth patterns, teaching the tongue to stay in proper
            position, keeping lips closed to increase nasal breathing, proper
            tongue position when swallowing and normal arch length.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Sleep disordered breathing in children can be noted by the following
            symptoms:
          </h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Restless sleep</li>
            <li>ADD/ADHD</li>
            <li>Bedwetting</li>
            <li>Allergies</li>
            <li>Nightmares</li>
            <li>Anger</li>
            <li>Difficult in school</li>
            <li>Frequent infections</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Sleep Disordered Breathing increases risk of ADD/ADHD by 50%
            (Bonuck, 2012) Children that exhibit ADD/ADHD may have a sleep
            disorder that keeps them in a stage of sleep that does not allow for
            growth and development. The brain does not have the ability to heal
            due to lack of a restorative sleep stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bedwetting and snoring are common in children with sleep disordered
            breathing again due to the fact that they do not spend enough time
            in a restorative healing stage but more in a restless one. When they
            can’t breathe, they don’t sleep properly. Snoring is not normal. It
            is the brain’s way of alerting us to an airway problem.

          <p>
            Children experience a number of growth spurts leading up to puberty.
            Each of those growth spurts can be used to harness the natural
            forces of the body to guide ideal jaw and tooth positioning.
            "Waiting until all the permanent teeth are in" is an archaic,
            deficient methodology for treating malocclusion, and more often than
            not, "traditional orthodontics" will straighten teeth but will not
            eliminate unhealthy oral habits, which will lead to either needing
            lifetime retention (a permanent retainer) or relapse of teeth in
            adulthood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Poor oral habits such as mouth breathing, thumb sucking, and an
            anterior tongue thrust cause a myriad of chronic inflammatory
            responses as well as dental malocclusion issues. It's important to
            note...
            <strong
              >These habits & malocclusions DO NOT SELF CORRECT! And they only
              get more difficult to treat with age.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Oral appliance therapy establishes nasal breathing which increases
            oxygen intake and ensures proper progression through stages of
            sleep. (what the brain needs to heal and promote growth). They
            eliminate bad habits such as mouth breathing, thumb sucking, tongue
            thrust, reverse swallow and eliminates open bite malocclusions. They
            train the tongue to a position that allows the airway to remain
            open, promote proper swallowing and proper speech development.

            We want to start early!!! Habit correctors can start as early as two
            years of age. Ideally we want to begin guiding the tongue as soon as
            possible but a pronounced crowding in the dentition of a five year
            old, open mouth postures and a weak chin are signs that the skeletal
            growth is off. Craniofacial growth between 5 and 7 years of age is
            critical to capturing correct arch width. We need to have enough
            space for the adult teeth to erupt into proper position. The same
            appliance that helps to open the airway also helps maintain
            craniofacial growth and gives the dental arches and teeth a guide to
            grow correctly. Greater than 80% of children that begin this therapy
            will not need subsequent orthodontic treatment. An added bonus to
            managing the craniofacial growth for proper airway is that the
            complete complex grows in a normal pattern, hence the teeth will
            too.

          <h3>Comprehensive Diagnosis</h3>
          <p>
            "You can't fix what you can't see"... this is the basis for a
            relatively common conversation we have with our new patient
            families. We hear from them, "This is the first time I've heard that
            my child has an issue that can or should be treated, but he/she has
            been seeing a dentist for years."
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically what is happening is that your dentist is focused on the
            "sickcare" side of dentistry, and more than likely, it is a
            combination of your existing dentist not being trained in this
            comprehensive treatment as well as he or she not having the
            extensive diagnostic tools that are needed to identify and treat
            these issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to traditional dental xrays that most people are
            familiar with, patients may undergo a CBCT scan to evaluate jaw,
            sinus, nasal, and airway health; handfilm x-ray to determine
            skeletal growth projection; digital scan for 3D dental models to
            iterate on treatment options; cephalometric x-ray; home sleep test;
            and electrodiagnosis and T-scan for TMJ disk placement review.
          </p>
          <p>
            These tools facilitate a comprehensive baseline so that we can build
            a predictable therapeutic plan, one that is rooted in our functional
            approach to oral health.

        <section id="HabitElimination" class="">
          <h3>Habit Elimination</h3>
          <p>
            In many pediatric dentistry cases, elimination of whatever habit(s)
            may be present for a child will correspond with a reduction in many
            chronic, systemic inflammatory symptoms that child was previously
            experiencing. Speech difficulties? Resolved. Chronic runny nose or
            sore throat? Fixed. Teeth grinding? Gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            We utilize a suite of various removable and fixed appliances in
            conjunction with behavioral modification techniques, routine office
            visits, and telemedicine checks to ensure our patients have success
            in this critical process. With the reduction in the habit, the oral
            environment will regain the proper balance of natural forces between
            tongue, lip, cheeks, jaw, and teeth, and the child will then be
            prepared to have improved eruption of adult teeth.
          </p>
          <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/DentalDeviceKids.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            To think of it another way, on average, a person swallows
            approximately 2x/min when awake during the day and 1x/min while
            sleeping. So if your child is spending a few hours during the day
            and at night thumbsucking, for example, that is a few hundred
            malpositioned swallows occuring every single day that is reinforcing
            improper tongue and tooth placement. Thus eliminating that habit
            sooner rather than later will minimize the amount of "damage" done
            by the imbalanced forces in the mouth.

            deliver upon the results each child deserves.

          <p>
            On occasion, we do collaborate with a local ENT team for tonsil and
            adenoid removal, but we almost always identify this concern prior to
            initiating treatment for the handful of patients that might need
            this procedure, and we will indicate the likelihood and timeline of
            this associated procedure so our patient families understand and
            know what to expect.

          <p>
            Depending on the age of the child and compliance with the prescribed
            therapy thus far, we will choose the individually-optimized therapy
            in conjunction with the parent. This includes but is not limited to
            Healthy Start by Orthotain.

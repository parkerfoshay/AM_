                <h3>What is Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)?</h3>
                <p>
                Apnea literally means “cessation of breath”. In other words, apnea
                  is when you stop breathing. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is when
                  the airway becomes obstructed during sleep. During sleep the tongue
                  and upper airway muscles relax and may begin to vibrate when
                  breathing. This vibration is snoring. As these muscles relax they
                  can collapse into the airway, restricting movement of air and
                  closing the throat. When you stop breathing your body responds as
                  your brain realizes you are not receiving oxygen and contracts the
                  throat muscles. This forces the airway open to allow air back into
                  the lungs and keeps you from suffocating. This is the “gasp” you
                  hear from your partner when it seems like they’ve stopped breathing.
                  They have.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This happens over and over throughout the sleep cycle. Imagine
                  struggling to breathe hundreds of times a night, every night and the
                  brutal days that follow. To keep the body from suffocating, your
                  brain shifts from a restful deep sleep into a light sleep, ever
                  vigilant to the maintenance of airway and the amount of oxygen being
                  exchanged. It’s a complex exchange and you may not even realize that
                  you are being woken over and over in the brain’s fight to keep you
                  from suffocating. But your partner does, your family members do and
                  believe it or not, you realize it too. When you wake in the morning
                  and you’re groggy, you find tasks more and more difficult to learn
                  and complete and reach for caffeine to help keep you awake- can you
                  see the signs of sleep deprivation? That obstructed airway leads to
                  light sleep and constantly being roused to breathe. This pattern of
                  sleep/wake leads to an abnormal pattern of biochemical processes and
                  OSA will lead to cardiovascular problems, heart attack, stroke,
                  impotence, acid reflux in response to those abnormal processes.

                <p>
                  We need to sleep deeply. The brain needs to remove wastes, store
                  information and begin the healing processes necessary to function
                  day to day. Deep sleep allows the brain to enter into the
                  maintenance phase. But remember, you’re suffocating and the brain
                  needs to keep your body in light sleep to constrict those airway
                  muscles and keep the oxygen flowing. How do you think your body is
                  reacting to this lack of oxygen? OSA is a progressive condition.
                  Left untreated, it will only get worse and leads to decline in
                  health and even death.

                <p>
                  You’re not alone. 1 in 4 adults in the United States (31% of men and
                  21% of women over 18) are at “high risk” for Obstructive Sleep
                  Apnea. This is based on the National Sleep Foundation’s 2005 Sleep
                  in America survey.

                  <h3>Is a dental device comfortable?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Most people easily adapt to wearing a dental sleep device at night.
                    After wearing the device for a short period of time it will become
                    part of your routine, and most people will hate to go to sleep
                    without it after they realize how much better they feel in the
                    morning. Once patients experience better sleep and improved health
                    associated with use of a dental device, it is rare for someone to
                    stop using it.

                  <h3>How long does a dental device last?</h3>
                  <p>
                    If the device is well-maintained, it should easily last for two to
                    five years before needing to be replaced. Most medical insurance
                    providers will pay for construction of a new dental sleep device
                    every two years and their longevity can be from one to many years in
                    length. Each type of device has its own warranty, and typically any
                    problems with the device during the first year are covered by the
                    cost of your initial treatment fee.

                  <h3>Can you make an appliance just for snoring?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Yes, dental sleep devices work quite well at reducing the sound and
                    severity of snoring. However, if you are a snorer and have never had
                    a sleep test, it is advisable to be screened or tested for the more
                    serious disorder of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Many snorers also
                    have obstructive sleep apnea, often without even realizing it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a diagnosis of primary snoring is made, then a dental sleep
                    device can be made to control the sound and severity of your
                    snoring. Snoring is a sign of an obstruction however a simple case
                    of snoring can be treated easily. A diagnosis of primary snoring
                    results in a device that requires fewer office visits and follow up
                    than an Obstructive Sleep diagnosis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Treating snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) with dental sleep
                    devices requires specialty training. It isn’t just a matter making a
                    mouth piece and pushing you out the door. Successful treatment
                    begins with choosing a dentist that has the proper specialty
                    training in Dental Sleep Medicine. Success also relies on having the
                    proper systems and clinical experience needed to effectively
                    implement dental sleep therapy treatment.

                    <h3>Is a custom device really necessary?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Store bought, boil and bite devices are not able to adjust to your
                      specific airway needs. It's like taking a cast from someone else's
                      arm and putting it on your own. Results are far less effective.
                      There is a process called "titration". This is how far the device
                      shifts the jaw forward and open to allow an increase in the airway
                      space. There are hinges specific to a custom device and more
                      importantly, specific to you, which allows the doctor to adjust as
                      needed. A generic one size fits all mouthpiece lacks this
                      adjustment. A boil and bite may hold your jaw forward or even open
                      your bite but is it allowing the proper airway space? Are you too
                      far forward or too open? Are you damaging your joint? How would you
                      determine that? A custom device fits snuggly up to the teeth and
                      avoids the bulk of the self-fitting device. It's a delicate balance
                      between airway and comfort. A custom device, made specifically for
                      your needs can allow you to breathe better and sleep deeply.

                      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious and life threatening
                      medical disorder. It is unwise to treat obstructive sleep apnea or
                      any other serious medical problem without proper medical supervision
                      and guidance. Failure to seek medical supervision and ‘do it
                      yourself’ can have serious medical risks, and can lead you to
                      believe the problem is fixed when in fact it is not.

            If the device is well-maintained, it should easily last for two to
            five years before needing to be replaced. Most medical insurance
            providers will pay for construction of a new dental sleep device
            every two years and their longevity can be from one to many years in
            length. Each type of device has its own warranty, and typically any
            problems with the device during the first year are covered by the
            cost of your initial treatment fee.

          <h3>Can you make an appliance just for snoring?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, dental sleep devices work quite well at reducing the sound and
            severity of snoring. However, if you are a snorer and have never had
            a sleep test, it is advisable to be screened or tested for the more
            serious disorder of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Many snorers also
            have obstructive sleep apnea, often without even realizing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a diagnosis of primary snoring is made, then a dental sleep
            device can be made to control the sound and severity of your
            snoring. Snoring is a sign of an obstruction however a simple case
            of snoring can be treated easily. A diagnosis of primary snoring
            results in a device that requires fewer office visits and follow up
            than an Obstructive Sleep diagnosis.
          </p>

            Treating snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) with dental sleep
            devices requires specialty training. It isn’t just a matter making a
            mouth piece and pushing you out the door. Successful treatment
            begins with choosing a dentist that has the proper specialty
            training in Dental Sleep Medicine. Success also relies on having the
            proper systems and clinical experience needed to effectively
            implement dental sleep therapy treatment.

          <h3>Is a custom device really necessary?</h3>
          <p>
            Store bought, boil and bite devices are not able to adjust to your
            specific airway needs. It's like taking a cast from someone else's
            arm and putting it on your own. Results are far less effective.
            There is a process called "titration". This is how far the device
            shifts the jaw forward and open to allow an increase in the airway
            space. There are hinges specific to a custom device and more
            importantly, specific to you, which allows the doctor to adjust as
            needed. A generic one size fits all mouthpiece lacks this
            adjustment. A boil and bite may hold your jaw forward or even open
            your bite but is it allowing the proper airway space? Are you too
            far forward or too open? Are you damaging your joint? How would you
            determine that? A custom device fits snuggly up to the teeth and
            avoids the bulk of the self-fitting device. It's a delicate balance
            between airway and comfort. A custom device, made specifically for
            your needs can allow you to breathe better and sleep deeply.

          <!-- <p>
            Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious and life threatening
            medical disorder. It is unwise to treat obstructive sleep apnea or
            any other serious medical problem without proper medical supervision
            and guidance. Failure to seek medical supervision and ‘do it
            yourself’ can have serious medical risks, and can lead you to
            believe the problem is fixed when in fact it is not.

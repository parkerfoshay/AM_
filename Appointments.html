          <strong
            >While treatment varies for each individual, below is an overview of
            what you can expect during treatment of your snoring or Obstructive
            Sleep Apnea (OSA):</strong
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1st Appointment – Free Consultation (approximately 45 minutes)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Once you have a thorough knowledge of snoring and Obstructive Sleep
            Apnea (OSA) and all of your questions and concerns have been
            addressed, then a limited oral exam may take place. The purpose of
            the examination is to assess the anatomy of your upper airway, the
            condition and stability of the teeth and TMJ (jaw joint), and to
            evaluate the range of motion of the jaw to determine if you are a
            good candidate for dental sleep therapy. Based on Dr. Anderson’s
            observations, she will be able to determine which type of dental
            sleep device will work best for your particular situation, and to
            discuss the likely outcomes of treatment.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have not previously had a sleep study, then your treatment
            coordinator will discuss the various options for having a sleep
            study.
          </li>
          <li>
            If it is determined that you are a good candidate for a dental sleep
            therapy, your treatment coordinator will discuss insurance,
            financial arrangements, and make an appointment to begin treatment.
          </li>
          
            <li>
              Regardless of whether or not treatment is scheduled, the findings
              of your exam will be sent to your physicians so they can discuss
              them at your next checkup.
            </li>
            <li>
              This appointment will be at no cost to you, although we may bill
              your medical insurance and accept their payments with your
              permission.
            </li>
          
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>2nd Appointment – Begin Treatment (approximately 1 to 1.5 hrs)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Dr. Anderson will work closely with your regular dentist. However,
            the treatment goals of your dental sleep provider are not the same
            as your regular dentist she will evaluate your teeth to
            insure they are stable enough to secure a dental sleep device, but
            will not generally perform an exam for preventative dental care. You
            should see your regular dentist for routine dental services. If your
            regular dentist has current x-rays, then our staff will obtain a
            copy prior to your visit. Our team will also obtain any necessary
            insurance pre-authorizations and medical documentation prior to your
            appointment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your appointment will consist of an examination of your oral
            dentition (teeth), soft tissues, airway, occlusion (bite), TMJ (jaw
            joint) and range of motion of your jaw. Any needed x-rays will be
            taken and digital photographs of your teeth and oral cavity will be
            completed. Impressions (molds) and a bite registration will be made.
            This mold will be used to fabricate your custom-made dental sleep
            device.
          </li>
          <li>
            A follow-up appointment will be made for 3 to 4 weeks for delivery
            of your dental sleep device.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3rd Appointment – Delivery of device (approximately 45 minutes)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your custom dental sleep device will have arrived and be ready for
            use. We will insert the device into your mouth and check it for fit,
            comfort and stability. Minor adjustments of the dental sleep device
            may be made to ensure a perfect fit. Once adequately fitted, you
            will be given instructions on the wearing and care of the device, as
            well what to expect during the first few weeks of wear.
          </li>
          <li>
            During your next few weeks, your initial symptoms will be reviewed
            and you will be asked to keep track of your symptoms.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will be given a copy of all of the information gathered in your
            previous appointment including x-rays in the form of your sleep
            report. Our staff will insure that this information is also sent to
            your physicians and regular dentist.
          </li>
          
        </ul>
        <h3>4th Appointment – 1st Device evaluation (30 to 45 minutes)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After you have started your dental sleep therapy treatment, our team
            will check to ensure that your dental appliance is being worn
            comfortably every night. Any areas of concern will be addressed, and
            questions that you have will be answered. Your symptoms will be
            discussed and documentation of improvement will be made.
          </li>
          <li>
            No further advancement or adjustment of the dental sleep device will
            be made unless you have already been wearing it for a month or more.
            Due to inflammation caused from snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea
            (OSA), the effectiveness of dental sleep devices steadily improves
            over the first month of use. Therefore, advancing or adjusting the
            dental sleep device is usually not recommended until the device has
            been worn for one month or longer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5th Appointment – 2nd Device evaluation (30 to 45 minutes)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After you are successfully wearing your dental sleep device, the
            next treatment goal is to correct your subjective symptoms and to
            also document objective success of treatment your Obstructive Sleep
            Apnea (OSA). We initially adjust your device based on subjective
            symptoms. It may require no adjustments after the initial placement,
            or it make take many small adjustments. Our team is trained and
            dedicated to obtain the best position for your dental sleep device.
            Once Dr. Anderson feels your dental sleep device is adjusted
            adequately for relief of your symptoms, you will be given a portable
            home sleep test to scientifically ensure that your Obstructive Sleep
            Apnea (OSA) is being controlled. Depending on the results of the
            initial test, you may need to repeat the portable home sleep test
            multiple times as your device is adjusted.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Additional Appointments – Device evaluation (10 to 45 minutes)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Follow-up appointments for health evaluation and dental device
            treatment success are typically conducted on a semi-annual basis, or
            as-needed with your dental sleep team.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Have more questions?</h3>
        <p>We are here to answer any questions that you may have about treating your snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) with dental sleep therapy. During your initial call or visit, you may be asked to provide us with health information so we can better understand your snoring or sleep disordered breathing problem. If you have already completed a sleep study, you will need to provide the contact information for your physician so our team can obtain a copy of your sleep report prior to your arrival. You will also be asked to complete a patient information page online, or bring a paper copy with you for your appointment. Once your information is received we will make an appointment for a free consultation. Successful treatment of snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) using dental sleep therapy relies on seeking treatment from a properly trained dentist who adheres to the latest standards of treatment.</p>
